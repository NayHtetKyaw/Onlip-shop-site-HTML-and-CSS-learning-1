                    <h2>
                        <p>In 2005, Ripples started out with a range of ladies flip flops, specializing in bold prints and patterns, 
                            comfortable and casual styles as well as excellent slip resistance soles. Over the years, we have kept our
                             beliefs and expanded our range to cater more lifestyle products such as backpacks, everyday tote bags and 
                              accessories for the trendy lady on the go.With our full-fledged concept stores in Singapore, multiple stores in Myanmar and wide 
                             distribution at departmental stores and resorts in Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand, Ripples 
                            has since gained fast-growing popularity among the young working ladies, college students and
                           teens. We are also stocked on major online shopping platforms.
